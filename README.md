Describe and implement a React Hook

An API for React called "Hooks" was implemented upon release that allows a developer to
use state and lifecycle methods of React inside a functional component.
Hooks improve code reuse and composition. 
They allow for better defaults and sharing non
visual logic with the use of custom hooks.
They also have the flexibility of moving up and down the components tree.
